## 🔧 **How the Enhanced System Works**

### **1. Real-Time Network Speed Monitoring**

#### **Comprehensive Speed Testing:**
```javascript
// Tests multiple file sizes for accurate measurement
const testSizes = [10, 50, 100, 200]; // KB
// Uses median speed for most accurate results
const medianSpeed = results[Math.floor(results.length / 2)];
```

#### **What You'll See:**
- **Actual Speed**: Real measured bandwidth (e.g., "8.5 Mbps")
- **Latency**: Network response time (e.g., "45ms")
- **Quality**: Based on actual speed (High/Medium/Low/Very Low)

#### **Speed Test Process:**
1. **Multiple Tests**: Downloads files of different sizes (10KB, 50KB, 100KB, 200KB)
2. **Median Calculation**: Uses median speed for accuracy (eliminates outliers)
3. **Latency Measurement**: Measures network response time
4. **Quality Classification**: 
   - **High**: >10 Mbps, <50ms latency
   - **Medium**: 5-10 Mbps, <100ms latency
   - **Low**: 2-5 Mbps, <200ms latency
   - **Very Low**: <2 Mbps, >200ms latency

### **2. Intelligent Recommendations System**

#### **Performance Analysis:**
The system analyzes your current metrics and provides:

- **🎯 Current Status**: Performance score (0-100)
- **📊 Optimal Scenarios**: Best settings for your network
- **⚡ Performance Tips**: Specific improvements needed

#### **Performance Scoring:**
```javascript
// Weighted scoring system
FPS Score (40%): 60+ FPS = 40 points, 45+ = 30, 30+ = 20, 15+ = 10
Memory Score (30%): <50% = 30 points, <70% = 20, <85% = 10
Network Score (30%): >10 Mbps = 30, >5 Mbps = 20, >2 Mbps = 10
```

#### **Recommendation Categories:**

**🟢 Excellent Performance (80-100 points):**
- All systems optimal
- Enable all adaptive streaming features
- Target 60 FPS

**🟡 Good Performance (60-79 points):**
