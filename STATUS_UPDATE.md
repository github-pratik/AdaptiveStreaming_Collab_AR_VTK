### Project Status Update (Implementation Report)

This report summarizes what we added, changed, and fixed in the codebase during the recent work. The language here is intentionally simple and direct.

---

## What’s New

- Gaze Prediction (ML) added
  - Created a `gazePredictor` module in `src/index.js` using TensorFlow.js (LSTM) to predict where the user will look next based on camera movement.
  - Added functions: `createGazeModel()`, `initializeGazePrediction()`, `addCameraSample()`, `getCameraVelocity()`, `maybePredictNextFocal()`, `preFetchHighResolutionData()`.
  - Integrated with adaptive streaming so the system can enable/disable the predictor based on network and performance.
  - Added UI controls: a button to toggle Gaze Prediction and a live Gaze Stats panel.
  - Documentation: Created and updated `GazePrediction.md` with a step-by-step plan and the final implementation notes.

- Viewport Culling and LOD are now used by gaze prefetch
  - The gaze predictor can “prefetch” by boosting LOD for objects near the predicted focal point.
  - Prefetch snaps to the nearest actor center to increase hit rate.

---

## Improvements

- Adaptive streaming interval and logging
  - Adaptive quality is still checked on a timer, but we made logging less noisy.
  - FPS logging can be throttled (every 5 seconds is recommended). This is done inside `startFPSMonitoring()`.
  - “Active optimizations” log now appears only when the set of active features actually changes (not on every metrics refresh).

- Network speed measurement is more robust
  - Some browsers report `navigator.connection.downlink = 0`. We now always run active bandwidth estimation and schedule periodic retests, so the UI doesn’t get stuck at 0 Mbps.
  - Latency is also measured periodically.

- Gaze confidence and prefetch effectiveness
  - Confidence now responds to both rotation (direction change) and translation (position change), not just rotation.
  - Prefetch radius increased and focal “snapped” to the nearest actor center, so prefetch is more likely to pick something meaningful.
  - Fix: Tensor shape bug resolved by converting history objects into numeric sequences before creating TF tensors.

## Files Touched

- `src/index.js`
  - Added `gazePredictor` object and initialization (`createGazeModel`, `initializeGazePrediction`).
  - Wired camera tracking and prediction: `addCameraSample`, `getCameraVelocity`, `maybePredictNextFocal`.
  - Implemented `preFetchHighResolutionData` to boost LOD near predicted focus.
  - Hooked initialization into `initializeApplication()`.
  - UI updates in `setupDimensionalityReductionControls()` to add Gaze controls and stats.
  - Reduced log noise: FPS logs can be throttled; optimization logs only on change; performance metrics interval remains configurable.
  - Network monitoring: always start bandwidth estimation, periodic re-measurements, and fallback handling when API returns 0 downlink.

- `GazePrediction.md`
  - New/updated documentation with phases, code snippets, and test plan.

## How to Run

1) Install and start (already configured):
```bash
npm run start
```
2) Open the app at `http://localhost:8080/` (the dev server usually opens a tab automatically).

---

## Where to Find Things

- Gaze controls and stats: in the UI controls table (look for “Toggle Gaze Prediction” and the “Gaze Stats” panel).
- Adaptive streaming controls and status: same controls table (adaptive toggle, network, performance stats, weights).
- Viewport culling status: console log lines like `Viewport culling: X/Y objects visible (Z% culled)`.

---

## Notes and Tips

- Prefetch behavior depends on scene scale. If your scene uses large units, increase `gazePredictor.preFetchRadius`.
- If FPS logs feel too frequent, throttle the log in `startFPSMonitoring()` to every 5 seconds.
- The gaze model is tiny by design for performance; if needed, we can tune LSTM units and intervals.

## Summary of Changes (Checklist)

- [x] Add ML-based gaze prediction (TF.js) and initialize it
- [x] Track camera motion (direction + position) for prediction
- [x] Prefetch LOD near predicted focus, snap to nearest actor
- [x] Add UI controls and live stats for gaze
- [x] Reduce log noise (FPS, active optimizations)
- [x] Improve network measurement (periodic active tests)
- [x] Update documentation (`GazePrediction.md`)
